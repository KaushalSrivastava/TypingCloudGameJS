# TypingCloudGameJS


This is a very basic Typing game in Vanilla JS, HTML5 & CSS3 I built way back when in 2013 when I was leaning JS.

In the game clouds fly by with words on them and the player has to type in the words correctly and score before the cloud reaches the other side. The game ends with 5 misses and the high score data gets stored in local storage.
